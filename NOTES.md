## Run — 2026-02-11
**Task:** Init Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind, and all defaults

**Decisions:**
- Used Tailwind CSS v4 (latest stable) which has a different setup than v3
  - Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of `@tailwind` directives
  - Requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin instead of `tailwindcss` directly in postcss.config
- Created Next.js app with App Router (not Pages Router)
- Used `src/app` directory structure as specified in task requirements
- Set up TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Added standard Next.js scripts: dev, build, start, lint

**Gotchas:**
- `create-next-app` wouldn't work in existing directory, had to set up manually
- Tailwind v4 has different PostCSS setup than v3 — had to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` separately
- Next.js build auto-modified tsconfig.json (changed jsx to react-jsx, added target ES2017)

**Next run should know:**
- Project structure is ready at /Users/cvp/Documents/projects/openclaw-smoking-lounge
- All base files created: src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/app/globals.css
- Build tested successfully with `npm run build`
- Next task will be setting up SQLite with Drizzle ORM
