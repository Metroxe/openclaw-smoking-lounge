# Notes

<!--
  This file is the memory between loop runs.
  Each run should READ this first and APPEND a new entry at the top (below this header).
  Keep entries concise but specific — file paths, function names, reasoning.
  Delete stale entries when they're no longer relevant.

<!-- Entry format:

## Run — YYYY-MM-DD
**Task:** What was worked on
**Decisions:** Any choices made and why
**Gotchas:** Anything surprising or tricky encountered
**Next run should know:** Anything that affects upcoming work
